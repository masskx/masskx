- "陋室空堂，当年笏满床；" - The humble room is empty, once filled with tablets of rank;
- "衰草枯杨，曾为歌舞场。" - The withered grass and poplars, once a ground for song and dance.
- "蛛丝儿结满雕梁，绿纱今又糊在蓬窗上。" - Spider webs cover the carved beams, green gauze now pasted again on the ragged windows.
- "说什么脂正浓，粉正香，如何两鬓又成霜？" - Talk of thick rouge and fragrant powder, how have the temples turned to frost again?
- "昨日黄土陇头送白骨，今宵红灯帐底卧鸳鸯。" - Yesterday, the yellow earth at the mound sent off white bones, tonight under the red lanterns, mandarin ducks lie together.
- "金满箱，银满箱，转眼乞丐人皆谤。" - Gold fills the chests, silver fills the chests, in the blink of an eye, all are beggars and all are slandered.
- "正叹他人命不长，那知自己归来丧！" - While sighing that the life of others is not long, who knows that they would return in mourning!
- "训有方，保不定日后作强梁。" - Even if you are well taught, you can't be sure that you will become a strong beam in the future.
- "择膏粱，谁承望流落在烟花巷！" - Choosing fine foods, who would expect to end up in the alley of glitz!
- "因嫌纱帽小，致使锁枷扛，昨怜破袄寒，今嫌紫蟒长。" - Because of despising the small official hat, one ends up carrying the cangue; yesterday pitying the torn coat for being cold, today despising the long python robe.
- "乱烘烘你方唱罢我登场，反认他乡是故乡。" - In the chaotic hustle and bustle, you finish singing and I go on stage, mistaking other places as the hometown.
- "甚荒唐，到头来都是为他人作嫁衣裳！" - How absurd, in the end, it's all about making wedding clothes for others!
